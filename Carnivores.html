Carnivorous dinosaurs usually had long, strong legs so that they could run quickly in order to catch their prey. They also needed large, strong jaws, sharp teeth, and claws to eat their prey.Good eyesight, a keen sense of smell, and a large brain to plan hunting strategies were also very important for successful hunting. Many of the carnivores (like Deinonychus, Coelophysis and Velociraptor) probably  hunted in packs. Most carnivores are scavengers when given the opportunity. Some dinosaurs were fish eaters, including Baryonyx and Suchomimus. Spinosaurus may have been a good swimmer (it had paddle-like feet similar to those of water birds) but it was the largest meat eating dinosaur even bigger than the T-rex. A few dinosaurs (including Coelophysis) have been found with small, fossilized animals within their fossil, giving information about their diet.
