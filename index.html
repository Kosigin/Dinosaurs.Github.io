Welcome to my dinosaur website! My name is Anton Kosigin, I would like to share my knowledege to you about the fascinating dinosaurs.  As we all know dinosaurs walked the Earth almost 160 million years ago and evolved into diverse shapes and sizes starting from  a 77 centimeter microraptor all the way to a 21.4 meter Argentinosaurus.These captivating reptiles were able to survive in a variety of ecosystems and each dinosaur had its own way of life. Dinosauyrs played a key role in evolutionary theory and many other scientific theories still used used today.
<p style="font-family:verdana">
It is generally thoguht that Earth was created by a big bang, about 4,600 million years ago.Eras and periods are based on the way rocks have formed and the fossils they contain. The Mesozoic Era spanned about 245-65 million years ago.  The continents were joined together at the beggining of the Mesozoic Era and started breaking aprt toward the middle of the Mesozioc Era. During this time sea reptiles,dinosaurs,mammals,birds and plants came to life. The Mesozoic Era is divided into the Triassic,Jurassic and Creataceous peroid. The earliest period was the Triassic period about 245-208 years ago.During this period small dinosaurs such as Staurikosaurus,Coelophysis and Euparkeria trod the Earth.The Jurassic period about 208-146 years ago was the time were continents started to break up. Dinosaurs became the dominant land animals and dinosaurs like Diplidocus,Brachiosaurus,Apatosaurus,Allosaurus and Stegosaurus became abundant in this period. The Cretaceous Period about 146-65 million years ago saw the extinction of dinosaurs. Tyrannosaurus rex,Giganotosaurus,Triceratops and Parasaurolophus are among the famous dinosaurs of this time.
