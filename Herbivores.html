Plant eating dinosaurs (herbivores) appeared around 220 years ago.They are often reffered as sauropods because unlike carnivores they walked on all fours. They also had thick pillar like legs, a long neck and a long tail although they had relatively small heads.  They were much larger than than even the biggest carnivores. These giants thrived during the Jurassic period which saw the growth of a variety of plants. These herbivores mostly fed on ferns,mosses and leaves from tall trees. The taller herbivores with long flexible necks, could graze on the leaves of the tallest trees while the smaller ones fed on small bushes. These dinosaurs didn't have to compete for food as there was always plenty for all. Even though carnivores were much quicker then thier plant eating relatives they often stayed away from them due to thier enormous strenght. They used thier tail as a whip or thier feet as giant crushers to inflict serious damage on the attacker.
