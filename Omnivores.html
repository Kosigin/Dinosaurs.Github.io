Omnivores were opportunistic dinosaurs that were able to eat both plants and meat. They ate seeds, plants, insects, small mammals, reptiles, and even other small dinosaurs! Their digestive tracks were able to digest both plants and animals. A surprising fact is that there is fossil evidence some omnivores even ate crustaceans. Omnivorous dinosaurs covered an insignificant 1-2% of dinosaur speecies.In many ways, omnivorous dinosaurs were special not only in their ability to eat both plants and meat but also their ability to adapt and survive in different habitats.Habitat was important for the diet of an omnivore dinosaur. Depending on the habitat, an omnivore dinosaur could eat plants or focus on hunting, being able to digest both food sources
